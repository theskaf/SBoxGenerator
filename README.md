# SBoxGenerator
SBox Generator

I'm currently embracing the glorious life of unemployment, where I have an abundance of time to resurrect all those personal projects that have been gathering dust over the years. 
Some of these projects may be more unrealistic than a unicorn riding a spaceship, but there are also quite a few gems that bring me immense joy. 
In my quest for a relatively decent encryption solution, I stumbled upon the fascinating realm of S-boxes*. Let me tell you, finding a descent S-box is like searching for a needle in a haystack. After some rigorous research, I unearthed a paper** that intrigued me, inspiring me to take on the challenge of building my own S-box generator. 

The Delphi code you'll find here showcases the implementation of the paper's two algorithms, accompanied by a dash of magic in the form of Luis Villasenor's Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform*** for generating mind-bending nonlinearity. 
Prepare to be amazed as you embark on this thrilling cryptographic journey!
